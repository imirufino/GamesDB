            <font class="mainTopics"> BACKGROUND INFORMATION </font> <br>
            Valorant is a first-person shooter created by Riot Games. <br>
            It is commonly described as a mix of Counter Strike: Global Offensive or CS:GO and Overwatch.<br>
            Prior to creating Valorant, Riot Games are most known for creating the MOBA game League of Legends.<br>
            Valorant was fully released on June 2, 2020 and it is currently only supported on Windows computers.</p>

      <p class="pItem" style="text-align: center">
            <font class="mainTopics"> MAIN OBJECTIVES </font> <br>
            Valorant is a 5v5 team game where you and your team try to win 13 rounds before the enemy team does.<br>
            As attackers, your goal is to plant the spike and ensure that it blows up before the enemies can defuse it.<br>
            As defenders, your goal is to defuse the spike before it blows up or ensure that the attackers <br> aren't able to plant it in the first place. Of course, another way to do this is <br> by simply eliminating the enemy team. However, this isn't the main goal of the game.</p>
      
          <p class="pItem" style="text-align: center">
            <font class="mainTopics"> GAME MODES </font> <br>
            Valorant has multiple game modes. These game modes are unrated, competitive<br> (also known as ranked), spike rush, deathmatch, escalation, replication, snowball fight and custom game.<br>
            The main game modes are unrated and competitive.<br>
            There are many ranked divisions in Valorant. These ranked divisions in order are <br> <font style="color:#d6d7d6">iron</font>, <font style="color:#cd7f32">bronze</font>, <font style="color:#bbbfbb">silver</font>, <font style="color:#ffd700">gold</font>, <font style="color:#4bc4d0">platinum</font>, <font style="color:#8364ad">diamond</font>, <font style="color:#1d9859">ascendant</font>, <font style="color:#9c2042">immortal</font> and <font style="color:#ffffb5">radiant</font>.<br>
            All of these ranked divisions are divided into 3 tiers aside from radiant,<br> which only includes the top 500 people from each region at one given time.</p>
      
          <p class="pItem" style="text-align: center">
            <font class="mainTopics"> AGENT ROLES </font> <br>
            Currently, there are 4 agent roles in Valorant.<br> These roles are duelist, initiator, controller and sentinel.<br> Firstly, duelists are meant to be the ones who go in first and spearhead your team's attack. <br> Duelist players are usually the star players of their team. Secondly, Initiators are supposed to<br> make the job of duelists easier by using their utility, usually to get info or blind the enemies. <br> Thirdly, controllers are supposed to cut off certain areas of the map with smokes to<br> make it easier to enter or harder to get in, depending on which side you are on. Finally,<br> sentinels are masters of defense, who are perfect for anchoring certain parts of the map.</p>

          <p class="pItem" style="text-align: center">
            <font class="mainTopics"> AGENTS & MAPS </font> <br>
              With the recent addition of Harbor, there are 20 playable characters in Valorant, which are called agents. <br> For beginners, the best agents to play would probably be Sage or Sova. <br> With Sage, you are meant to heal or ressurect your teammates and keep enemies back.<br> Meanwhile, with Sova, you are meant to get precious info on the enemies. <br> There are also 8 maps that you can play, with Split not being available for play in ranked or unrated. <br> Each map has its own unique feature. Examples of this include<br> Bind having teleporters and Haven having 3 bombsites instead of the usual 2.</p>

            <font class="mainTopics"> HOW TO DOWNLOAD </font> <br>
            To download Valorant, you must go to <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/download/" style="text-decoration:underline">this website</a> and press the download button.<br> The game will then download and all you will need to do is open the client and you are ready to go!<br> When you start playing, it is important to pick one agent that you will pick all the time.<br> However, it is also important to have a secondary agent as well in case your teammate<br> picks your first choice before you can. As I said above, the best agents to start with are Sage and Sova.</p>
          
        <p class="pItem" style="text-align: center">
          <font class="mainTopics"> TIPS & TRICKS </font> <br>
          When playing Valorant, there are 3 things you want to focus on. These 3 things are aim, gamesense and mentality.<br> Firstly, aim is important because, no matter how smart your outplays are, at the end of the day, you still need to hit your shots.<br> You can practice your aim in external aim trainers like Aim Lab or you can pratice within Valorant itself,<br> either by queueing deathmatch or in the practice range. Secondly, gamesense is what allows you to put yourself<br> in good positions to shine and be more consistent. It is improved over time just by playing. However, it can be improved<br> faster by recording your own gameplay and learning from your mistakes. It is also good to consciously think<br> why you decided to do one thing over another thing while playing as well. Lastly, mentality is also important. It is a huge skill<br> to think positive so you won't rage quit right away. You can have amazing aim and gamesense, but if you have a bad<br> mentality, it will not at all be easy to improve in terms of rank.</p>
