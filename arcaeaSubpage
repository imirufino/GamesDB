            Arcaea is a mobile rhythm game created by Lowiro. <br>
            Rhythm games are games that challenges a player's sense of rhythm <br>
            by making them tap notes to the beat according to a judgement line. <br>
            However, unlike other rhythm games, this game is 3-dimensional, <br>
            which makes for more difficult and challenging gameplay. <br>
            Currently, Arcaea is free to play, with some content locked behind a paywall. <br>
            Arcaea was released on March 9, 2017 on IOS and Android, and May 18, 2021 for Nintendo Switch.</p>
      
          <p class="pItem" style="text-align: center">
            <font class="mainTopics"> DIFFICULTIES, PERFORMANCE AND JUDGEMENT </font> <br>
            In the game, there are currently 4 difficulties, with one of them <br>
            requiring special methods to be unlocked. These difficulties are <font style="color: cyan">PAST</font>, <font style="color:lime">PRESENT</font>, <font style="color: purple">FUTURE</font>, and <font style="color:red">BEYOND</font>, <br> 
            each increasing in difficulty respectively. Your score determines your grade, which is determined by your performance. <br> 
            Scores are determined by the time you hit the notes when they reach the judgement line. <br> 
            For every note, you would get max points if you get a <font class="fontGradient1">◇PURE◇</font>, half points if you get a <font class="fontGradient2">◇FAR◇</font>, and no points if you get a <font class="fontGradient3">◇LOST◇</font>. <br> 
            Below are the score ranges and the grades you receive within that score range. </p>
    <!--Table showing the score ranges of each corresponding grade-->

            <font class="mainTopics"> PARTNERS & RECOLLECTION GAUGES </font> <br>
            Currently, there are at least 50 partners in Arcaea (with more to come!), each having <br>
            a different type of recollection gauge.  Recollection Gauges are the bars you see on the left side of the screen when you <br> 
            play a song. There are partners with different RGs that make gameplay by means of increasing the recollection rate <br> 
            or reducing the damages of LOSTS (like Hikari or Winter Eto and Luna), or partners that make gameplay harder <br> 
            by means of making your recollection rate reduce significantly (like Zero Hikari, Tempest Tairitsu, or Fatalis Hikari). <br>
            The goal for partners with <font style="color: lime">EASY</font> or <font style="color: yellow">NORMAL</font> recollection gauges is to maintain your recollection rates equal or above 70. <br> 
            On the other hand, the goal for partners with <font style="color: red">HARD</font> recollection gauges is to maintain your recollection rates above 0.
            
          <p class="pItem" style="text-align: center">
          <font class="mainTopics"> TYPES OF NOTES </font> <br>
          Since this game is 3-dimensional, there are different notes other than what you normally expect in rhythm games. <br> 
            Floor notes appear on the floor and you must tap to hit them when it reaches the bottom judgement line to not get a LOST. <br> 
            Long notes are the same as floor notes, except you must hold them when it reaches the bottom judgement line and release when it ends. <br> 
            Sky notes are the same as floor notes, except they can be found anywhere within the top judgement line and the bottom judgement line. <br> 
            You must tap to hit  when it reaches your playing area. <br> 
            Arc notes are the same as long notes, except they can move up and down, and also left and right. <br> 
            <font style="color: cyan"> Blue arcs </font>must be hit with your left hand and <font style="color: magenta"> pink arcs </font> must be hit with your right hand. <br> 
            Traces have no contribution on gameplay, they are just there for decoration. <br> 
            Seen below are the 5 types of notes that can be seen in a chart in Arcaea. </p>

          <font class="mainTopics"> HOW TO UNLOCK </font> <br>
          There are a lot of songs that require very specific steps to unlock. Here are links to tutorials on how to unlock these. <br>

          <font class="mainTopics"> TIPS & TRICKS </font> <br>
          It is MASSIVELY encouraged for you to play the Beginner and Advanced Tutorials first before diving in into the game, <br> 
          because this game has a concept that is way more different than any other rhythm game. <br>
          It is also important to fix your SETTINGS first (found in the top section of Arcaea's Music Play) <br>
          according to your liking, like the offset, or the notespeed (scrollspeed). This game is mainly compromised of <br>
          accuracy, precision, timing, speed, and readability. All of these would develop as you progress further or play more into the game. <br>
          To improve readability, I would recommend getting an app called <u><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sound-game-training/id1088874473" target="_blank">Sound Game Training</a></u> (currently only for IOS at the moment). <br> 
          Simply find a chart from YouTube and you can practice it according to how you like it! <br>
          Another thing I can suggest is finding hand cameras of people who have managed to Max PM charts if you are confused how to do some gameplay. <br>
          You also need good dexterity for this game because there are certain patterns like crossing your hands just to hit notes. <br> </p>

          <font class="mainTopics"> FUN FACTS </font> <br>
          <ul>
          <li>This game has collaborated with a lot of other rhythm games! Some of these include maimai, WACCA, Ongeki, and CHUNITHM.</li>
          <li>This game also hosted 2 song-making contests, with 1 of them ongoing right now!</li>
          <li>Currently, there are 9 known charters who have charted all of the songs in Arcaea. Some notable ones are Toaster, Nitro, and Exschwashion.</li>
          <li>As of writing this, there are currently 289 songs in Arcaea! (+2 if including Last | Eternity and Last | Moment)</li>
          <li>There is a chart called "dropdead", where the <font style="color: lime">Present</font>(9.5) difficulty has a higher difficulty than the <font style="color: purple">Future</font>(9.1) difficulty!</li>
          <li>The highest difficulty at the moment is <font style="color: red">Beyond 12</font>, with the song being Testify!</li>
          <li>There are also April Fools Charts (celebrated on April 1st of every year), where the new charts during that day break some of Arcaea's normal mechanics, like out-of-bound notes!</li>
          <li>Similarly, the <font style="color: red">Beyond</font> difficulties break some of Arcaea's normal mechanics, like extended playing field, and the increasing of 4 lanes of gameplay to 6! (this can exclusively be found in the Final Verdict pack)</li>
          <li>You can add Hikari and Tairitsu as friends with the Friend IDs of 000 000 001 and 000 000 002 respectively!</li>
          <li>Arcaea can be played with different handstyles, like thumb gameplay, index gameplay, or multifinger gameplay!</li>
